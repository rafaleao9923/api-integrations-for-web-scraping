# Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview
The API Integrations for Web Scraping, Data Analysis, and Database Management system provides a robust platform for:
- Automated web scraping with configurable parameters
- Advanced data processing and analysis
- Efficient database operations
- Real-time data visualization
- Scalable infrastructure for high availability

## 2. Functional Requirements

- [FR-2] Implement scheduling options (cron, interval, one-time)
- [FR-3] Provide real-time scraping status updates
- [FR-4] Handle automatic retries and error recovery

### Data Processing
- [FR-5] Implement data cleaning and transformation pipelines
- [FR-6] Support statistical analysis and trend detection
- [FR-7] Generate interactive visualizations
- [FR-8] Handle real-time data streams

### Database Operations
- [FR-9] Implement CRUD operations via API
- [FR-10] Support bulk data operations
- [FR-11] Maintain data integrity and consistency
- [FR-12] Provide audit logging for all operations

### API Management
- [FR-13] Implement OAuth2 authentication
- [FR-14] Provide comprehensive API documentation
- [FR-15] Support rate limiting and throttling
- [FR-16] Handle API versioning

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
### Performance
- [NFR-1] Handle up to 100 concurrent scraping jobs
- [NFR-2] Process 10,000 records/second in data pipeline
- [NFR-3] Maintain API response time under 500ms

### Scalability
- [NFR-4] Support horizontal scaling via Kubernetes
- [NFR-5] Handle database sharding and partitioning
- [NFR-6] Support distributed caching

### Reliability
- [NFR-7] Maintain 99.9% uptime
- [NFR-8] Implement automated failover
- [NFR-9] Support data backup and recovery

### Security
- [NFR-10] Implement OAuth2 with JWT authentication
- [NFR-11] Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- [NFR-12] Implement role-based access control

## 4. System Architecture
The system follows a microservices architecture with:
- API Gateway (FastAPI)
- Scraping Engine (Scrapy)
- Data Processing Pipeline (Pandas/NumPy)
- Database Layer (PostgreSQL)
- Caching Layer (Redis)
- Task Queue (Celery)
- Visualization Engine (Matplotlib/Plotly)

## 5. Data Flow
1. User initiates scraping job via API
2. Scraping Engine processes request and stores raw data
3. Data Processing Pipeline cleans and transforms data
4. Analysis results stored in database
5. Visualization Engine generates charts
6. Results cached in Redis for quick access
7. User retrieves results via API

## 6. Security Requirements
- Implement OAuth2 with JWT tokens
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Encrypt sensitive data in database
- Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Maintain audit logs for all operations

## 7. Performance Requirements
- Handle 1000+ concurrent API requests
- Process 1M+ records in data pipeline
- Maintain sub-second response times for 95% of requests
- Support horizontal scaling for all components

## 8. Deployment Requirements
- Support Docker-based containerization
- Provide Kubernetes deployment configurations
- Implement CI/CD pipelines
- Support blue-green deployments
- Provide monitoring and alerting
